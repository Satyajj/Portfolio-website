# Portfolio Website

Hey there! This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase my projects, skills, and a bit about myself. Built using simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”because Iâ€™m still learning and having fun with it!

## Features
- **Smooth Scrolling** for a seamless browsing experience.
- **Responsive Design** so it works well on all devices.
- **Cool Hover Effects** on navigation and service cards.
- **Project Previews** in the portfolio section.
- **Contact Form & Social Links** to stay connected.

## Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Satyajj/portfolio-website.git
   ```
2. Open the folder:
   ```bash
   cd portfolio-website
   ```
3. Launch `index.html` in your browser. Thatâ€™s it!

## Folder Structure
```
portfolio-website/
â”‚-- images/
â”‚-- index.html
â”‚-- style.css
â”‚-- script.js
â”‚-- README.md
```

## Customization
- Swap out the background image (`background.jpeg`) in `images/`.

- Add more projects in the **portfolio** section.

## Deployment
### **GitHub Pages:**
Itâ€™s already live! Check it out:

## Some To-Dos (Maybe?)
