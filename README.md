# Portfolio Website  

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my **personal portfolio website** where I showcase my projects, skills, and ways to reach me. I'm still an **amateur**, just figuring things out, so this site is pretty much a work in progress! ðŸ˜„  

## What's Inside?  
- **Simple & Clean Design** â€“ Not too fancy, but it does the job.  
- **Mobile-Friendly** â€“ Works on phones too!  
- **Projects Showcase** â€“ A little preview of what Iâ€™ve worked on.  
- **Contact Section** â€“ So you can reach out if needed!  

## Tech Used  
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

## How to Use It?  
1. Clone this repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Satyajj/portfolio-website.git
   ```  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser â€“ Thatâ€™s it!  

## Customization  
- Want to change the background? Swap the image in the `images/` folder.  
- Add your own projects? Edit the **portfolio section** in `index.html`.  
- Change the colors? Tweak `style.css` a bit.  

## Hosting (GitHub Pages)  
I've **not** hosted it yet, but if you want to:  
1. Push your code to GitHub.  
2. Go to **Settings > GitHub Pages**.  
3. Choose `main` branch, save, and your site will be live! ðŸš€  

## Other Stuff  
- Might add **animations & cool effects** later.  
- Open to feedback! Feel free to fork and experiment.
